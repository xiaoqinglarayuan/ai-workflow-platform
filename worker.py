    ARQ `after_job_end` hook: Saves the final status and details of a completed job

    This function is called by the ARQ worker after a job finishes (either
    successfully or with an error). It retrieves job information using
    `process_job_info`, prepares it for database insertion using the
    `JobHistoryCreate` schema, and then saves it via `create_job_history`.
